Poetry is a Python tool for packaging and dependency management with some extra batteries included. This post only focuses on the dependency management part.

In python it's quite easy to install packages - just run `pip install packageA`, but it's more complex if you have multiple packages. And this complexity only shows over a longer time span if you want to have reproducible installs.

For example, if you look at `pandas==2.1.4` dependencies, it has `numpy>=1.26.0`, `python-dateutil>=2.8.2`, and a few others.

If you want to install `pandas==2.1.4` and `numpy==1.20.0` you can't do it from a single `requirements.txt` file as pip will throw an error since `pandas` depends on a newer version of `numpy`. But that won't throw an error if `python-dateutil` version 3.0.0 is released in the future. `pip` has improved its dependency resolution since version `20.3` and can prevent some of the issues like conflicting versions.

You can still use two separate `pip install` commands - this will work without throwing any errors. First install `pandas==2.1.4` then separately `numpy==1.20.0` and this can have unexpected behaviour in your application. This is not uncommon in Dockerfiles, where pip installs can be added in separate `RUN` commands (this is an antipattern anyway; don't do this).

If you still want to use `pip` after reading this post - make sure you have all of your dependencies in a single requirements file, you can generate it using `pip freeze` or `pip-tools`. It's a good idea to separate your list of dependencies from the final list, or good luck with manually resolving version conflicts in the future.

Why poetry?

Poetry supports lock files out of the box, which can be generated when you update the dependencies. This lock files a list of all dependencies in your project and dependencies of these dependencies.

If you have `pandas==2.1.4` in your lock file and want to run `poetry add numpy==1.20.0` it simply won't work as it will check existing packages in the lock files and their dependencies.

It's common to git commit this lock file together with the application code - you can also validate that the file is valid by running poetry checks and installing the same dependencies when running the CI/CD pipeline.

Having fewer steps to manage your dependencies also reduces the human error when adding extra dependencies, i.e. you won't be adding a `pip install` in Dockerfile since you have a tool for managing your dependencies as you'd have a step that takes all `poetry.lock` and installs it with a single command.

Use poetry for dependency management in 2024.
